# Nightvision

Invision clone made with React.js. It is not a full blown clone, it's just a prototype. [Read about how I build this here](https://medium.com/@juli/how-i-built-a-mini-invision-using-react-590357aa7d08#.yyq6dvco8).

This project was created using create react app. So if you want to try it out just do an `npm install` and then an `npm start`. You can also try a live version in [https://nightvision.now.sh/](https://nightvision.now.sh/).
